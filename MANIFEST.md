# PFA — logic, APIs and backend

Split out of `PFA_Full_Website_v1_63.zip`. This half holds everything that makes
the journeys **work**: the serverless API, the shop/store integration, payments,
validation, persistence, tests and deployment config.

The other half (`PFA_UI_Content`) holds the pages, styling, media and content.
Together the two zips reconstitute the original archive exactly.

### The API — one function, many routes
`api/index.js` is the single Vercel serverless function; `vercel.json` rewrites
`/api/:path*` and `/products/:handle` into it. Handlers live in `lib/routes/`
and are registered in the `LOADERS` table in `api/index.js`. Vercel Hobby caps
the project at 12 functions, which is why nothing else may be added under `api/`.

| Area | Routes |
| --- | --- |
| Store (Paws & Tails / Shopify) | `paws-catalog`, `pfa-pay-start`, `pfa-pay-confirm` (direct pay, Razorpay), `pfa-orders` (seller checkout fallback), `pfa-order-status` (token, handle, or PFA id + contact), `pfa-store-reconcile`, `product-page`, `webhooks/*` |
| Payments (CCAvenue, PFA is merchant) | `payment/create`, `payment/response`, `payment/health` |
| Colony Caregiver Card programme | `caregiver/apply` (410, retired), `caregiver/card` (read by `caregiver-card.html`), `caregiver/order`, `caregiver/replace`, `caregiver/admin-shipment`, `caregiver/email-worker` |
| Members | `member/auth/start`, `member/auth/verify`, `member-status`, `verify-card` |
| Admin panel backend | `admin/*` (Firebase ID token + `admin: true` claim) |
| Shared | `location-lookup`, `pfa-submissions`, `photo/remove-background` |

Two money flows, deliberately kept apart: **PFA** is merchant of record for
donations and Give/Send (CCAvenue); **Paws & Tails** is
merchant for the store (Shopify checkout → seller's Razorpay). `lib/payment.js`
rejects any attempt to push a store item through CCAvenue.

### Client-side logic in `assets/`
The browser-side halves of those journeys: cart and storage kernel (`site.js`),
shared field validation (`field-rules.js`), checkout, product, order and order
tracking, Colony Caregiver Card, journey scaffolding
(`journey-core.js`), Firestore data layer (`circle.js`), QR, photo capture and
cutout, geolocation.

### `_inline-extracts/`
Several pages keep their behaviour in an inline `<script>` instead of in
`assets/` — `store.html` alone carries ~80 KB of storefront logic. A file-level
split cannot separate that from its markup, so those blocks are snapshotted
here as **read-only reference copies**. The live code is in the `.html` files in
the UI zip. See `_inline-extracts/README.md`.

## Cross-zip dependencies — read this before running anything

Neither zip is a runnable site on its own; the split is for hand-off and review,
not for deployment. To run or deploy, merge both trees back over each other.

**Coming from the UI zip, this half needs:**

| Needed | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `*.html` | every route the API serves or redirects to |
| `assets/data.js` | `PFA_DATA` — units, animals, stories, guides, the local product list |
| `assets/site.css`, `assets/*.css` | referenced by `test/site-integrity.test.js` |
| `assets/search-index.json` | written by `scripts/build-search-index.js` |
| the `seo:start`/`seo:end` block in every page head | written by `scripts/build-seo.js` |
| `sitemap.xml` | written by `scripts/build-search-index.js` |
| `media/**` | referenced by pages and the audit |

**Living here but loaded by the UI:**

| File | Note |
| --- | --- |
| `assets/field-rules.js` | **`require()`d by `lib/payment.js`, `lib/firebase.js`, `lib/submissions.js`, `lib/caregiver.js`** *and* `<script>`-tagged by 47 pages. It is deliberately one file: the whole point is that the form and the API cannot disagree about what a valid Indian mobile number is. Do not copy it into the UI zip — keep the single copy here. |
| `assets/site.js` | loaded by 46 pages; holds cart, storage, validation and submission helpers |
| `assets/pfa-location.js` | loaded by 36 pages |

Tests will not pass in isolation: `test/site-integrity.test.js`,
`test/cta-coherence.test.js`, `test/admin-page.test.js`, `test/help-page.test.js`,
`test/store-experience.test.js` and others read the HTML and CSS. Merge first,
then `npm test`.

`test/photo-cutout.test.js` and `test/store-experience.test.js` reference
`assets/three.min.js` and `assets/pfa-store-cinematic.js`, which are **absent
from the original archive** — that is pre-existing, not a result of this split.

## Secrets
None are in here. `.env.example` lists the names only; values live in Vercel.
