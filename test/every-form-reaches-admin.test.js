/* Every public form, one by one, all the way to the panel.
   
   site-integrity.test.js already checks that no form sends a kind the server
   would refuse. That is a static scan of the source. This is the other half:
   it drives the real intake route with a real payload for each kind, then reads
   the record back through the real admin route, so a break anywhere along the
   chain — intake, reference allocation, storage, admin listing, stage moves —
   fails here rather than in production.

   The map below is the contract. A new public form adds a row; a form that
   stops reaching the panel takes its row down and this fails. */
