/* The food order this file's predecessor guarded was retired in v1.300, but
   the fault it existed for did not retire with it: a district typed as free
   text under the wrong state - Punjab with Udupi under it - was accepted,
   saved and paid for. The same discipline now guards the colony caregiver
   application on get-involved.html, where district and state print on the
   card itself, so the picker tests moved there (this file was
   donate-district.test.js until v1.300). The asset-integrity tests never
   cared which page read the table and stay as they were.

   Retired with the donate picker, deliberately: the PIN-to-state inference
   and the campaign-link prefill were features of that picker alone, and the
   caregiver form has neither. If either returns, its tests return with it.

   The list is a snapshot of an administrative geography that changes, so the
   checks here are about the pairing being enforced and the data agreeing with
   itself, not about any one district being current. */
