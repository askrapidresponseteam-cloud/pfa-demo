   the way a news section is named — the term press and visitors look for.

   "The Wire" collides with thewire.in, a major Indian news publication, and
   sat beside The Wall in the nav; "Dispatches" collides with `dispatched`,
   which already means "the card has been posted" throughout the caregiver
   shipment flow in lib/caregiver.js. */
