/* Every public form and every paid application reaches the admin panel and
   sends the person an acknowledgement, and production says whether it can
   send email at all.

   Asked on 16 Sep 2026: does a membership application trigger its email, and
   does every submission send one? scripts/check-emails.js drives each form
   through the real intake route and each paid application through CCAvenue's
   create and callback, offline, with a mail provider that records instead of
   sending. This holds it green, so ship.sh stops a deploy in which any form
   stops filing or stops acknowledging. */
