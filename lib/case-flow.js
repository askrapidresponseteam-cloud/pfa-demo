/* The life of a case: which states it may move to next, and the one piece of
   code that moves it.

   Until 8 Oct 2026 there were no rules. Any of the four generic statuses
   could be written over any other, by two routes that did it two ways: a
   case closed twice lost the first close's note, a reopen left the old
   closer's name on it, an application could be "handled" (a status its kind
   does not have) but never "shortlisted" (one it does), and a stale read in
   one request undid another administrator's close. Now:

   - Generic kinds: new -> in-progress -> handled | spam, and a closed case
     (handled or spam) only moves again by being reopened, to new or
     in-progress. In progress may also be handed back to new.
   - Kinds with stages (S.STAGES in lib/submissions.js) move between their
     own stage keys. A closing stage (approved, rejected, withdrawn, revoked,
     delivered; or the last stage of a kind that names none of those) is
     left only by a reopen to an open stage, or by another closing stage.
     A few stages belong to an action, not to a status move: a caregiver
     application is "Card issued" only by issuing the card (approve).
   - The same state again is refused (SAME_STATUS), so nothing is rewritten
     by a repeated click.
   - Leaving a closed state keeps the close it ends in record.closes[]
     ({ status, by, at, note }) and clears handledBy, handledAt and
     handledNote, so a reopened case never shows the old closer as its owner.
   - Every move runs in a transaction that reads the record and checks the
     state it is moving from, so two people never undo each other.

   Both admin routes that change a status (lib/routes/admin/case.js and the
   older lib/routes/admin/submission-status.js) use changeStatus() below;
   lib/inbound-mail.js uses takeUpStatus() and isClosed(). */
