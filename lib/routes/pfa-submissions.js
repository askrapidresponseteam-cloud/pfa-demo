   GET  /api/pfa-submissions?reference=PFA-C-2026-00042&contact=asha@example.com

   The server issues the reference. The browser sends what was typed and gets
   a number back; if the number never arrives, the form says so instead of
   showing one that was never recorded.

   Following a submission needs the number and the email or mobile given with
   it. What comes back is the status and when it changed, never the report.

   Every submission is confirmed in the themed letter (lib/confirmations.js),
   and the answer says what happened to that email - sent, on its way, not
   sent, or no address given - so the page can tell the person where to look,
   Spam and Junk included, instead of promising an email that is not coming. */
