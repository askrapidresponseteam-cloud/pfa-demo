/* What a person is told once they have sent something to PFA: in the letter
   emailed to them, and on the page they are looking at when it goes.

   ---- why this file exists -------------------------------------------------

   The membership welcome letter was the one confirmation written to the
   brief: one flat electric blue, poster type, the number large. Everything
   else went out as the grey acknowledgement; a colony caregiver application,
   paid for, went out with no email at all; and no page told anyone that the
   email might be sitting in Spam. The pages could not have said so anyway:
   /api/pfa-submissions answered `acknowledged` and pfa-forms.js kept only the
   reference, so a page had no idea whether an email had gone.

   So every kind now gets the letter, worded for what was actually sent, with
   its number called what it is: an application number for an application, a
   member number for a membership, a reference for a report. Every page that
   shows a number says whether a confirmation went, to which address, and
   where to look when it is not in the inbox. The words for both live here,
   so the email and the screen cannot disagree.

   The lead lines are the pages' own success copy. Each `path` is the stage
   list the form itself shows under "Where an application goes", or the public
   statuses from lib/submissions.js; test/confirmations.test.js reads the
   pages and fails if the two drift apart. */
