/* What each public form is allowed to send, and what it must send.

   ---- why this file exists -------------------------------------------------

   /api/pfa-submissions checked every field it was given against the shared
   rules in assets/field-rules.js, which is the right check for a field it
   recognises. It did not check that the field was there at all. Nothing was
   ever required, so an empty POST

       { "kind": "PFA-CR", "data": {} }

   allocated a reference and filed a cruelty report with no account of what
   happened, nobody's name and no way to call anyone back. Nor was a choice
   ever judged against the list it was chosen from: "animal": "Dragon" was
   filed exactly as "Dog" was, because the browser's <select> is a courtesy
   and not a boundary.

   So the spec below is the other half of validation: the browser decides what
   is convenient to type, this decides what may be recorded.

   ---- the standard it is written to ---------------------------------------

   Rejecting a real report costs more than storing a junk one. Someone
   standing over an injured animal is not going to fill the form in twice.
   So this file is deliberately narrow:

     - `required` names only fields the page itself already marks required,
       with the page's own wording, so nobody can be refused here for
       something the form never asked them for.
     - `options` lists only choices whose values are fixed in the markup.
       careers.html's Zone list is built at runtime from PFA_ZONES, so zone is
       validated as text and not against a list that could drift out of date.
     - `requiredWhen` names a field needed only for some answers to another
       (the Zone, for the Zonal Head), with the message the page shows.
     - unknown extra keys are not rejected. They are capped and checked for
       length as before. A form that grows a field keeps working; the field
       simply gets no rule until someone adds one.

   test/submission-fields.test.js reads the pages and asserts every list here
   still matches the markup, so the two cannot drift apart silently. */
