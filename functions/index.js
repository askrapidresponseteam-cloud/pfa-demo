 * from Vercel, and the router already handles it:
 *
 *   Vercel rewrote /api/<x> to /api/index?__route=<x>. Firebase Hosting cannot
 *   add a query parameter in a rewrite, but the router falls back to reading
 *   the pathname, so /api/<x> resolves on its own.
 *
 * A second case, /products/<handle>, injected parameters from the path. It
 * retired with the shop.
