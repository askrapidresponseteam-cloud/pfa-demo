/* Bring the founder page's YouTube stills and titles onto PFA's own server.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The Watch grid was type-only for a documented reason: Instagram and
   Facebook will not hand a still to a third-party page without their script
   or an app token, and their CDN links are signed and expire. YouTube is the
   exception. It publishes a still for every film at a plain, unsigned
   address, and a title at an oEmbed endpoint that needs no key.

   That makes a thumbnail possible. It does not make hot-linking a good idea,
   for the same three reasons the CineKind photographs were brought local:

     1. It spends someone else's bandwidth on every page view.
     2. It sets a third-party request on a page whose whole promise is that
        nothing third-party loads until play is pressed. A still fetched from
        i.ytimg.com breaks that promise before the visitor has done anything.
     3. It breaks silently. The tile's poster is laid in only once the file
        has decoded, so a still that stops resolving does not show a broken
        image: it simply stops appearing, and nobody notices.

   So this downloads them once, into media/founder-films/, where the page
   already points.

     npm run media:founder              fetch stills and report the titles
     npm run media:founder -- --rewrite fetch, and write the titles into the page

   The titles are fetched rather than typed. These are eight films of a named
   person, and a title invented here would be a caption asserting something
   about a real recording. YouTube is asked what each one is called.

   Run it with a network connection. Re-running is safe: a still already on
   disk is left alone unless --force is given.
