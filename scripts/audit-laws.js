/* An audit of laws.html, for a reviewer.

     npm run audit:laws

   What this can and cannot do, plainly:

   It CAN check the things a machine can check — that every answer carries a
   citation, that a provision is cited consistently across the answers that use
   it, that no answer leaves the reader without a route, that no answer quotes
   a token fine, that the framing does not seat the reader in the offender's
   chair, and that citations follow one house format.

   It CANNOT tell you whether a section number is the right section, whether a
   holding is stated accurately, or whether a rule has been amended since. **No
   script, and no assistant, can certify this page as legally correct.** That
   needs an advocate practising in this area, and this report exists to make
   their pass shorter by putting every provision and every answer that relies
   on it in one list. */
