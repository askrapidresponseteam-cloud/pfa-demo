# Confirms the tree, the service account and the browser all name the same
# Firebase project, confirms somebody can actually sign in, runs the tests,
# and only then replaces ~/Desktop/PFA_Website (keeping its git history),
# pushes, and deploys the rules.
#
# The order matters and is not negotiable. This release retires the two shared
# admin secrets, so once it is live the ONLY way into /admin.html is a Firebase
# account carrying the admin claim. Pushing before confirming that claim exists
# locks everyone out of the panel with no way back in over the web. So the
# claim is checked first and nothing is pushed if the check fails.
#
# Nor is anything on disk touched first. On 7 Sep 2026 this script picked the
# most recently modified *firebase-adminsdk*.json on the Desktop, which was the
# key for pfa-oldsite, a project this site left. The sign-in check stopped the
# push, but the working tree had already been replaced and the claim granted
# on the wrong project. The key is now chosen by the project it belongs to
# (scripts/firebase-project.js), a key for a retired project is refused
# outright, and every check runs in the unpacked tree before the live one is
# backed up and replaced.
#
# To name the key yourself instead of letting the script find it:
#
#   PFA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=~/Desktop/that-key.json bash scripts/ship.sh you@...
#
# Nothing here prints a secret. The service account is read from the file,
# held in the environment for the length of this run, and cleared at the end.
